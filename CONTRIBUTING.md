## 🚀 Pull Requests

Before creating a Pull Request, please start a Discussion or open an Issue to describe your planned changes. This helps the maintainers and community provide feedback early and ensures your contribution aligns with the project goals. You can skip this step for minor fixes like typos or small documentation updates.

- Do NOT open pull requests from your `main` branch. Always create a new feature ( for example `add-cell-tests` ) in your fork before submitting a PR.
- Ensure your changes are tested with both WinUI 3 and Uno Platform targets.
- Add or update unit tests and integration tests to cover your changes.
- Complete the PR checklist, and ensure your code is tested with both targets.
- Update documentation as needed to reflect your changes.
